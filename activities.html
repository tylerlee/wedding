  <h2>Bridal Veil Falls</h2>
  <p>
    As the longest natural free-falling waterfall in Colorado, Bridal Veil Falls
    is a must-see for hikers in the area. The falls cascade 365 feet and views
    from the top stretch out across Telluride and the neighboring village of
    Pandora. The entire hike is on a dirt and gravel roadway (so wear some sturdy
    shoes), about 2 miles (one-way) and gains 1,200 feet in elevation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The top of the falls is also home to the Smuggler-Union Hydroelectric Power
    Plant, originally built in 1907 to supply the neighboring mine. It was fully
    restored in the 1990s and today provides about 25 percent of Telluride's
    electric power.
  </p>
  <p>
    The trail leading up the massive waterfall is suitable for hikers and bikers
    as well as four-wheel drive vehicles. Once at the top of the falls, the trail
    narrows and vehicles are no longer permitted but the trail offers a
    spectacular aerial view of the town below. Past hikers say the elevation
    change is barely noticeable, but the climb to the top of the falls can
    be a little slick.
  </p>
  <p>
    To reach the falls, head east of town on Colorado Avenue for about 3 miles
    then follow the dirt road marked County Road. If you want to make the hike
    on foot, park at the Valley View Area parking lot and follow the switchbacks
    up the 1.2 miles to the bottom of the falls.

  <h2>Bear Creek Trail</h2>
  <p>
    Bear Creek Trail is a must-do for those who visit Telluride in summer.
    Starting at the end of South Pine Street, this trail leads 2½ miles (one-way)
    through the Bear Creek Preserve to Bear Creek Falls. Several other trails
    branch off from the falls, leading more adventurous hikers farther into
    the preserve.
  </p>
  <p>
    The view of Bear Creek Falls is well worth the trek up 1,050 feet in
    elevation. The trail welcomes hikers and bikers every day from sun up to
    sundown. You do not have to pay for trail access.

  <h2>Day Trip to Ouray, CO</h2>
   <p>
    The historic city of Ouray is located just a short hour's drive (50 miles)
    from Telluride. Ouray claims itself as the "Little Switzerland of America"
    and is set in a box canyon similar to Telluride's. Visitors will enjoy the
    thermal activity at the local Ouray Hot Springs swimming pool (open all year)
    and Vapor Caves. Ouray Hot Springs are just 1 hour drive from Telluride.
    There are 3 pools: hot, warm and cool.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Ouray, you can also take a beautiful, historic drive or four-wheel over
    to Telluride along Yankee Boy Basin and the Imogene Pass. True Grit was
    filmed in this area in 1968 and included scenes in the city of Ouray and
    most notably, the interior of the Ouray County Court House. Visiting Ouray
    can offer the perfect day trip from Telluride.

    During the warmer months, visitors and residents head to Town Park on the
    southeast edge of town to enjoy scenic walking paths and picturesque picnic
    spots. Its 36 acres are also home to an outdoor swimming pool, basketball
    and tennis courts, a fishing pond, multiple playgrounds and even a Frisbee
    golf course. Plus, the park provides campgrounds, and plays host to many of

  <h2>Telluride Historical Museum</h2>

  <p>
    Housed in the town's former hospital, the Telluride Historical Museum
    recounts the village's exciting history, from its gold-mining days to the
    development of the world-renowned Telluride Ski Resort. More than 9,000
    artifacts and 1,400 photos live here, depicting Telluride's past. Visitors
    can learn about the region's relationship with the Ute Native American tribe,
    the difficulty of mining gold and, of course, the emergence of notorious
    robber Butch Cassidy. The museum also offers the chance to experience the
    village as it was a century ago by tagging along on a Telluride Afoot audio
    walking tour. Previous visitors say that the Telluride Historical Museum is
    a must-see for history buffs, due to its informative displays and
    easy-to-understand layout.

  <h2>Mesa Verde National Park</h2>

  <p>
    Mesa Verde National Park, located between Durango, Cortez and only 2.5 hours
    from Telluride, is rich in history with spectacular views stretching over
    one hundred miles. The National Park was established to preserve
    archaeological sites built by the Ancestral Puebloans dating back to
    550 A.D. With a spectacular look into the lives of the Puebloans, these
    inhabitants lived in the Four Corners region of Colorado for over 700 years.
    Spend hours looking at more than 4,700 archaeological sites including
    600 cliff dwellings, pueblos, masonry towers, farming structures,
    and much more. Take time to look back into the past at one of the best
    preserved and most notable National Parks of its kind in the United States.
    But that's not all... Mesa Verde National Park has numerous hiking trails,
    beautiful camping grounds, heritage foods and cuisine, Native American
    handcrafts and shopping, and more.

  <h2>Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park</h2>

  <p>
    The Black Canyon of the Gunnison's unique and spectacular landscape was
    formed slowly by the action of water and rock scouring down through hard
    Proterozoic crystalline rock. No other canyon in North America combines the
    narrow opening, sheer walls, and startling depths offered by the Black Canyon
    of the Gunnison.
  </p>

  <p>
    Carved by the Gunnison River two million years ago, this 12-mile long canyon
    is one of Colorado's most spectacular. The 2,300-foot Painted Wall is the
    state's highest cliff. Great for white water rafting and fishing, and known
    for supreme hiking terrain. Located 13 miles outside of Montrose, the Black
    Canyon Park is about two hours from Telluride.

  <h2>Moab, Utah</h2>

  <p>
    Moab, Utah is located 134 miles from Telluride and is one of the best day
    trips in the region. As you leave Telluride's 13,000 foot peaks, in just
    under 3 hours you end up in the desert town of Moab. The drive takes you
    through a beautiful canyon and Paradox Valley where climbers flock from all
    over to experience this superb rock. Moab hosts many visitors each year,
    mostly to visit the Arches and Canyonlands National Parks. Mountain biking,
    camping, 4-wheeling, and much more adventures await you in this awesome town.

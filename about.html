<h1>A Little About Us</h1>

<p>
  Tyler and Jennifer are both from McKinney, Texas. The attended Valley
  Creek Elementary School together, and were even in some of the same classes!
  They then attended Faubion Middle School together, followed by McKinney
  High School.
</p>
<p>
  It wasn't until senior year of high school that they began hanging out
  socially, and soon began dating.
</p>
<p>
  After attending separate colleges (Tyler at UT and Jennifer at Tulane),
  they spent a few years apart pursuing their education and beginning careers.
  By 2012, they found themselves back in Dallas, and opted to give it another
  shot! Tyler and Jenn are currently living in Uptown Dallas with their dog, Mya.

<h2>The Proposal</h2>

<p>
  While on an absolutely unbelievable summer vacation in 2015, Tyler finally
  popped the question. It was the second day of a two week trip, and was the
  perfect time. Tyler and Jenn had just arrived in Monument Valley, UT,
  and were spending some time driving around and checking out the sights.
  Tyler setup his camera to take a few sunset photos, and Jennifer snapped a
  few photos for Facebook. Moments later, Tyler was down on one knee, and
  Jennifer was beyond surprised! The wonderful day was followed by two weeks
  of exploring several beautiful sites and national parks, and what was
  simply the best trip yet.

<h2>The Big Day!</h2>

<p>
  With their love for travel and the outdoors, Tyler and Jennifer
  thought it only fitting to have a beautiful Colorado wedding. They will
  be joined by family and friends atop a mountain in Telluride, CO and
  surrounded by amazing views, for what will hopefully be the most
  beautiful and fun celebration.

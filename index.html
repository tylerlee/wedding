          <h1>A Little About Us</h1>

          <p>
          Tyler and Jennifer are both from McKinney, Texas. The attended Valley
          Creek Elementary School together, and were even in some of the same classes!
          They then attended Faubion Middle School together, followed by McKinney
          High School.
          </p>

          <p>
          It wasn't until senior year of high school that they began hanging out
          socially, and soon began dating.
          </p>

          <p>
            After high school, Tyler attended the University of Texas at
            Austin, and Jennifer headed off to Tulane University. By 2012,
            they’d both made their ways back to Dallas for work and graduate
            school. They’ve been living in Uptown Dallas for the past few years. This summer however,
            they are embarking on a new adventure and moving to Connecticut! It will
            definitely be a change living away from friends, family and warm weather.
            But Jennifer and Tylerandlooking forward to a new adventure and chapter in their lives. And Many visitors from home!
          </p>

          <h2>The Proposal</h2>

          <p>
          While on an absolutely unbelievable summer vacation in 2015, Tyler finally
          popped the question. It was the second day of a two week trip, and was the
          perfect time. Tyler and Jenn had just arrived in Monument Valley, UT,
          and were spending some time driving around and checking out the sights.
          Tyler setup his camera to take a few sunset photos, and Jennifer snapped a
          few photos for Facebook. Moments later, Tyler was down on one knee, and
          Jennifer was beyond surprised! The wonderful day was followed by two weeks
          of exploring several beautiful sites and national parks, and what was
          simply the best trip yet.
          </p>

          <h2>The Big Day!</h2>

          <p>
          With their love for travel and the outdoors, Tyler and Jennifer
          thought it only fitting to have a beautiful Colorado wedding. They will
          be joined by family and friends atop a mountain in Telluride and
          surrounded by amazing views, for what will hopefully be the most
          beautiful and fun celebration.
          </p>

          <h1>Our Wedding</h1>

          <p>
            The ceremony and reception will be taking place the evening of Sunday, August 28th,
            in Telluride, CO. We hope you are able to join us for a fun-filled evening of
            celebration!!
          </p>

          <p>
            Please see below for event times, details and information on the beautiful venues!
          </p>

          <p>
            Event attire is semi-formal. The ceremony will take place outdoors, so
            please check the weather prior to packing! Late August usually yields highs
            in the low 70s and lows around 40 overnight so layers are recommended. It should be a nice break
            from the hot Texas summer!
          </p>

          <p>
            Cocktail hour will follow the ceremony, on the deck at Gorrono Ranch. Dinner and
            reception will then be inside Gorrono, with access to the deck throughout
            the evening.
          </p>

          <h3>Please see details and pictures below!</h3>

                The wedding party and family will likely be kicking off the weekend at the historic bar that the
                New Sheridan Hotel, located in Telluride. So if you’re in town, please drop by to say hello and
                grab a drink with the soon to be newlyweds!
              </p>
              <p>
                The hotel and bar are located at 231 W Colorado Ave, Telluride, CO 81435. This is just a few
                blocks walk from the Telluride gondola station. If you are staying in Mountain Village, simply
                take the free gondola over to Telluride (approx. 10 minute ride). Hop off in Telluride, and walk
                just a few blocks toward Colorado Avenue. For the fastest route, walk past Oak BBQ, hang a
                left at S Fir street, and walk 3 blocks to the corner of Colorado. The gondola runs until late in the
                evening, so we’d love to see you in the area!

        <h1>Getting Around Telluride</h1>

        <p>
          Telluride is one of the most pedestrian-friendly cities in the United States.
          Once you get here, you won’t need to rent a car thanks to services such as
          the free Gondola, Dial-a-Ride/Telluride Concierge and Galloping Goose bus
          service.
        </p>

          <h2>Free Gondola</h2>

          <p>
            Linking two towns, the Gondola is the only public transportation system of
            its kind in North America. Running daily from 7am to midnight, the
            13-minute gondola ride eliminates the 20-minute, 8-mile drive between
            both towns. The midway point of the gondola is San Sophia Station,
            where the ceremony will take place. The gondola operates year-round, with
            temporary off-season closures

          <h2>Pretty Lights Festival</h2>

          <p>
            August 26th and 27th , an outdoor music festival will take place at Town Park in Telluride. Lineup is still in
            progress, but tickets may be advanced purchased. There should be day and night events, so if you’re
            looking for a music fest while in town, this is a great weekend to enjoy it!

          <h2>Bridal Veil Falls</h2>
          <p>
            As the longest natural free-falling waterfall in Colorado, Bridal Veil Falls
            is a must-see for hikers in the area. The falls cascade 365 feet and views
            from the top stretch out across Telluride and the neighboring village of
            Pandora. The entire hike is on a dirt and gravel roadway (so wear some sturdy
            shoes), about 2 miles (one-way) and gains 1,200 feet in elevation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The top of the falls is also home to the Smuggler-Union Hydroelectric Power
            Plant, originally built in 1907 to supply the neighboring mine. It was fully
            restored in the 1990s and today provides about 25 percent of Telluride's
            electric power.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trail leading up the massive waterfall is suitable for hikers and bikers
            as well as four-wheel drive vehicles. Once at the top of the falls, the trail
            narrows and vehicles are no longer permitted but the trail offers a
            spectacular aerial view of the town below. Past hikers say the elevation
            change is barely noticeable, but the climb to the top of the falls can
            be a little slick.
          </p>
          <p>
            To reach the falls, head east of town on Colorado Avenue for about 3 miles
            then follow the dirt road marked County Road. If you want to make the hike
            on foot, park at the Valley View Area parking lot and follow the switchbacks
            up the 1.2 miles to the bottom of the falls.

          <h2>Bear Creek Trail</h2>
          <p>
            Bear Creek Trail is a must-do for those who visit Telluride in summer.
            Starting at the end of South Pine Street, this trail leads 2½ miles (one-way)
            through the Bear Creek Preserve to Bear Creek Falls. Several other trails
            branch off from the falls, leading more adventurous hikers farther into
            the preserve.
          </p>
          <p>
            The view of Bear Creek Falls is well worth the trek up 1,050 feet in
            elevation. The trail welcomes hikers and bikers every day from sun up to
            sundown. You do not have to pay for trail access.

          <h2>Day Trip to Ouray, CO</h2><p>The historic city of Ouray is located just a short hour's drive (50 miles)
            from Telluride. Ouray claims itself as the "Little Switzerland of America"
            and is set in a box canyon similar to Telluride's. Visitors will enjoy the
            thermal activity at the local Ouray Hot Springs swimming pool (open all year)
            and Vapor Caves. Ouray Hot Springs are just 1 hour drive from Telluride.
            There are 3 pools: hot, warm and cool.</p>
          <p>
            In Ouray, you can also take a beautiful, historic drive or four-wheel over
            to Telluride along Yankee Boy Basin and the Imogene Pass. True Grit was
              filmed in this area in 1968 and included scenes in the city of Ouray and
              most notably, the interior of the Ouray County Court House. Visiting Ouray
              can offer the perfect day trip from Telluride.

          <h2>Telluride Historical Museum</h2>

          <p>
            Housed in the town's former hospital, the Telluride Historical Museum
            recounts the village's exciting history, from its gold-mining days to the
            development of the world-renowned Telluride Ski Resort. More than 9,000
            artifacts and 1,400 photos live here, depicting Telluride's past. Visitors
            can learn about the region's relationship with the Ute Native American tribe,
            the difficulty of mining gold and, of course, the emergence of notorious
            robber Butch Cassidy. The museum also offers the chance to experience the
            village as it was a century ago by tagging along on a Telluride Afoot audio
            walking tour. Previous visitors say that the Telluride Historical Museum is
            a must-see for history buffs, due to its informative displays and
            easy-to-understand layout.

          <h2>Mesa Verde National Park</h2>

          <p>
            Mesa Verde National Park, located between Durango, Cortez and only 2.5 hours
            from Telluride, is rich in history with spectacular views stretching over
            one hundred miles. The National Park was established to preserve
            archaeological sites built by the Ancestral Puebloans dating back to
            550 A.D. With a spectacular look into the lives of the Puebloans, these
            inhabitants lived in the Four Corners region of Colorado for over 700 years.
            Spend hours looking at more than 4,700 archaeological sites including
            600 cliff dwellings, pueblos, masonry towers, farming structures,
            and much more. Take time to look back into the past at one of the best
            preserved and most notable National Parks of its kind in the United States.
            But that's not all... Mesa Verde National Park has numerous hiking trails,
            beautiful camping grounds, heritage foods and cuisine, Native American
            handcrafts and shopping, and more.

          <h2>Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park</h2>

          <p>
            The Black Canyon of the Gunnison's unique and spectacular landscape was
            formed slowly by the action of water and rock scouring down through hard
            Proterozoic crystalline rock. No other canyon in North America combines the
            narrow opening, sheer walls, and startling depths offered by the Black Canyon
            of the Gunnison.
          </p>

          <p>
            Carved by the Gunnison River two million years ago, this 12-mile long canyon
            is one of Colorado's most spectacular. The 2,300-foot Painted Wall is the
            state's highest cliff. Great for white water rafting and fishing, and known
            for supreme hiking terrain. Located 13 miles outside of Montrose, the Black
            Canyon Park is about two hours from Telluride.

          <h2>Moab, Utah</h2>

          <p>
            Moab, Utah is located 134 miles from Telluride and is one of the best day
            trips in the region. As you leave Telluride's 13,000 foot peaks, in just
            under 3 hours you end up in the desert town of Moab. The drive takes you
            through a beautiful canyon and Paradox Valley where climbers flock from all
            over to experience this superb rock. Moab hosts many visitors each year,
            mostly to visit the Arches and Canyonlands National Parks. Mountain biking,
            camping, 4-wheeling, and much more adventures await you in this awesome town.

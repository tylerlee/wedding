The attended Valley\n          Creek Elementary School together, and were even in some of the same classes!\n          They then attended Faubion Middle School together, followed by McKinney\n          High School.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n          It wasn\'t until senior year of high school that they began hanging out\n          socially, and soon began dating.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n          After attending separate colleges (Tyler at UT and Jennifer at Tulane),\n          they spent a few years apart pursuing their education and beginning careers.\n          By 2012, they found themselves back in Dallas, and opted to give it another\n          shot! Tyler and Jenn are currently living in Uptown Dallas with their dog, Mya.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>The Proposal</h2>\n\n          <p>\n          While on an absolutely unbelievable summer vacation in 2015, Tyler finally\n          popped the question. It was the second day of a two week trip, and was the\n          perfect time. Tyler and Jenn had just arrived in Monument Valley, UT,\n          and were spending some time driving around and checking out the sights.\n          Tyler setup his camera to take a few sunset photos, and Jennifer snapped a\n          few photos for Facebook. Moments later, Tyler was down on one knee, and\n          Jennifer was beyond surprised! The wonderful day was followed by two weeks\n          of exploring several beautiful sites and national parks, and what was\n          simply the best trip yet.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>The Big Day!</h2>\n\n          <p>\n          With their love for travel and the outdoors, Tyler and Jennifer\n          thought it only fitting to have a beautiful Colorado wedding. They will\n          be joined by family and friends atop a mountain in Telluride, CO and\n          surrounded by amazing views, for what will hopefully be the most\n          beautiful and fun celebration.\n          </p>\n\n\n          <div class=\'inline-gallery\'>\n            <div class=\'column\'>\n              <div class=\'gallery-item\'>\n                <img\n

With a spectacular look into the lives of the Puebloans, these\n            inhabitants lived in the Four Corners region of Colorado for over 700 years.\n            Spend hours looking at more than 4,700 archaeological sites including\n            600 cliff dwellings, pueblos, masonry towers, farming structures,\n            and much more. Take time to look back into the past at one of the best\n            preserved and most notable National Parks of its kind in the United States.\n            But that's not all... Mesa Verde National Park has numerous hiking trails,\n            beautiful camping grounds, heritage foods and cuisine, Native American\n            handcrafts and shopping, and more.\n          </p>\n\n          <a class='button' href='http://www.nps.gov/meve/index.htm'>Learn More</a>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class='panel visit'>\n          <img src='assets/images/black.png' />\n          <h2>Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park</h2>\n\n          <p>\n            The Black Canyon of the Gunnison's unique and spectacular landscape was\n            formed slowly by the action of water and rock scouring down through hard\n            Proterozoic crystalline rock. No other canyon in North America combines the\n            narrow opening, sheer walls, and startling depths offered by the Black Canyon\n            of the Gunnison.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Carved by the Gunnison River two million years ago, this 12-mile long canyon\n            is one of Colorado's most spectacular. The 2,300-foot Painted Wall is the\n            state's highest cliff. Great for white water rafting and fishing, and known\n            for supreme hiking terrain. Located 13 miles outside of Montrose, the Black\n            Canyon Park is about two hours from Telluride.\n          </p>\n\n          <a class='button' href='http://www.nps.gov/blca/index.htm'>Learn More</a>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class='panel visit'>\n          <img src='assets/images/moab.png' />\n          <h2>Moab, Utah</h2>\n\n          <p>\n            Moab, Utah is located 134 miles from Telluride and is one of the best day\n            trips in the region. As you leave Telluride's 13,000 foot peaks, in just\n            under 3 hours you end up in the desert town of Moab. The drive takes you\n            through a beautiful canyon and Paradox Valley where climbers flock from all\n            over to experience this superb rock. Moab hosts many visitors each year,\n            mostly to visit the Arches and Canyonlands National Parks.

<h1>Local Transportation</h1>

<p>
  Telluride is one of the most pedestrian-friendly cities in the United States.
  Once you get here, you wonâ€™t need to rent a car thanks to services such as
  the free Gondola, Dial-a-Ride/Telluride Concierge and Galloping Goose bus
  service.
</p>

<h2>Free Gondola</h2>

<p>
  Linking two towns, the Gondola is the only public transportation system of
  its kind in North America. Running daily from 7am to midnight, the
  13-minute gondola ride eliminates the 20-minute, 8-mile drive between
  both towns. The midway point of the gondola is San Sophia Station,
  where the ceremony will take place. The gondola operates year-round, with
  temporary off-season closures
